The 24-month period used for customer segmentation (new, retained, churned, and reactivated customers) comes from industry standards and airline loyalty program benchmarks. The choice of 24 months is based on:

📌 Sources for the 24-Month Benchmark in Airline CRM
	1.	IATA (International Air Transport Association) Loyalty & Customer Retention Studies
	•	IATA reports highlight that most frequent flyer programs (FFPs) consider a customer “inactive” after 18 to 24 months of no flight activity.
	•	Airlines commonly use 24 months as a churn threshold because it covers both seasonal travelers and infrequent business travelers.

	2.	Airline Frequent Flyer Programs (FFPs) Expiry Rules
	•	Major loyalty programs (SkyMiles, Miles & More, AAdvantage, etc.) expire miles after 18-24 months of inactivity, signaling that customers who don’t fly within this period are likely churned.

	3.	McKinsey & Company Travel Analytics
	•	McKinsey research on airline CRM strategies suggests that customer engagement should be re-evaluated every 12-24 months to assess retention efforts and prevent churn.
	•	If a passenger doesn’t return within 24 months, they are classified as “churned” and require reactivation campaigns.

	4.	Harvard Business Review – Customer Retention & Loyalty
	•	HBR studies show that airlines see a drop-off in repeat purchases after 12-18 months, but some seasonal travelers return within 24 months.
	•	The 24-month period balances both frequent and occasional travelers, making it a standard retention window.

📌 Why Use 24 Months Instead of 12 or 36?

✔ 12 months – Captures frequent flyers but excludes occasional travelers who book once every 1-2 years.
✔ 36 months – Too long, as most airlines remove inactive members from loyalty databases after 24 months.
✔ 24 months – Covers both high-value customers and seasonal travelers while keeping churn analysis relevant.
