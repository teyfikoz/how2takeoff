Introduction to Basic Aviation Cargo Concepts: Key Metrics and Formulas

Air cargo transportation is a vital part of the global economy, allowing airlines to transport goods efficiently over long distances. Unlike passenger flights, cargo operations focus on maximizing freight load, revenue efficiency, and operational cost control. Let’s break down the key metrics and formulas used in air cargo transport in a beginner-friendly way.

1. Why Do Airlines Transport Cargo?

Cargo transportation helps airlines increase revenue by utilizing available aircraft space efficiently. There are two main types of air cargo operations:

A. Belly Cargo (Passenger Aircraft Cargo)
	•	Airlines use the cargo hold of passenger aircraft to transport goods.
	•	This allows airlines to generate additional revenue without adding extra flights.
	•	Often includes mail, small packages, or time-sensitive goods.

B. Dedicated Freighters (Full Cargo Aircraft)
	•	Airlines operate cargo-only aircraft to transport large volumes of goods.
	•	Common for express deliveries (DHL, FedEx, UPS) and bulk freight transport.
	•	Includes perishables, electronics, medical supplies, and heavy machinery.

Since air cargo is expensive compared to sea and land transport, it is typically used for urgent, high-value, or perishable goods.

2. Key Air Cargo Metrics and Formulas

To measure the performance of air cargo operations, airlines use specific key performance indicators (KPIs), just like in passenger transport.

A. Available Freight Tonne Kilometers (AFTK)

Formula:
￼

Meaning:
AFTK measures the total capacity available for cargo transport. It is similar to ASK (Available Seat Kilometers) in passenger transport, but instead of seats, we consider cargo capacity in metric tonnes.

Example:
If an airline operates a cargo aircraft with 50 tonnes of available space over a 5,000 km route:
￼

B. Revenue Freight Tonne Kilometers (RFTK)

Formula:
￼

Meaning:
RFTK represents the actual volume of paying cargo transported. It shows how much of the available cargo space is actually utilized.

Example:
If 40 tonnes of cargo were transported on the same 5,000 km flight:
￼

C. Freight Load Factor (FLF)

Formula:
￼

Meaning:
This metric shows how efficiently an airline is filling its cargo space. A higher Freight Load Factor means better efficiency.

Example:
￼
An 80% Freight Load Factor means 80% of available cargo space was filled with revenue-generating cargo.

D. Cargo Yield (Revenue per RFTK)

Formula:
￼

Meaning:
This measures how much revenue an airline earns per tonne-kilometer of transported cargo.

Example:
If an airline earned $500,000 in cargo revenue for 200,000 RFTK:
￼

E. Cost per Available Freight Tonne Kilometer (CAF/K or CASK for Cargo)

Formula:
￼

Meaning:
This shows how much it costs the airline to operate each available tonne-kilometer. Lower costs lead to higher profitability.

Example:
If the airline’s total cargo operating cost is $400,000 for 250,000 AFTK:
￼

F. Revenue per Available Freight Tonne Kilometer (RAFK)

Formula:
￼

Meaning:
RAFK tells us how much revenue is generated per available tonne-kilometer of cargo capacity. It is similar to RASK (Revenue per Available Seat Kilometer) in passenger transport.

Example:
￼

G. Profitability of Air Cargo

Formula:
￼

Example:
￼
If RAFK is greater than CAFK, the airline is making a profit on cargo operations.

3. Simple Real-World Example: Cargo Performance of an Airline

Let’s analyze an airline’s monthly cargo performance:

Metric	Value	Meaning
AFTK	5,000,000	Total available cargo capacity in tonne-kilometers
RFTK	3,800,000	Total revenue-generating cargo in tonne-kilometers
Freight Load Factor (FLF)	76%	Efficient cargo space utilization
Total Cargo Revenue	$19,000,000	Revenue from cargo services
Total Cargo Costs	$14,000,000	Operating costs for cargo flights
Cargo Yield (Revenue per RFTK)	$5.00 per RFTK	Revenue per tonne-kilometer transported
CAFK (Cost per AFTK)	$2.80 per AFTK	Cost per tonne-kilometer available
RAFK (Revenue per AFTK)	$3.80 per AFTK	Revenue per tonne-kilometer available
Profit per AFTK	$1.00 per AFTK	The airline is profitable in cargo operations

4. Key Insights & Strategies for Cargo Airlines
	1.	Improve Freight Load Factor (FLF)
	•	Better capacity planning ensures higher cargo space utilization.
	2.	Increase Cargo Yield
	•	Focus on high-value cargo (electronics, pharmaceuticals).
	•	Offer premium freight services (temperature-controlled cargo, express shipping).
	3.	Reduce Cost per Available Freight Tonne Kilometer (CAFK)
	•	Optimize fuel efficiency and reduce ground handling costs.
	•	Use more fuel-efficient aircraft (Boeing 777F, Airbus A350F).
	4.	Diversify Revenue Streams
	•	Offer e-commerce partnerships (Amazon, Alibaba).
	•	Expand into perishable goods transport (fruits, seafood, flowers).

Final Thoughts

Cargo operations play a crucial role in the profitability of airlines, especially during economic downturns when passenger demand drops. Airlines must optimize cargo load, reduce costs, and maximize revenue per tonne-kilometer to remain competitive.
