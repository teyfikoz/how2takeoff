2. Customer Acquisition, Retention & Win-Back Costs

2.1 Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

📌 Definition:
Customer acquisition cost represents the total expenses an airline incurs to attract a new customer, including marketing, sales, and promotional costs.

📌 Formula:

2.2 Customer Retention Cost (CRC)

📌 Definition:
Customer retention cost refers to the investment needed to maintain existing customers through loyalty programs, discounts, and personalized services.

📌 Formula:

CRC = \frac{\text{Loyalty Program & Customer Service Costs}}{\text{Number of Retained Customers}}
\]

📌 Example:
If an airline spends $200,000 on loyalty programs to retain 50,000 customers:
