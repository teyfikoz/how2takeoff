This is a great roadmap for integrating CRM analytics into your airline data system! 🚀 By adding customer analytics alongside aircraft information and carbon calculations, the system can provide comprehensive insights into both operational efficiency and customer behavior.

📊 How CRM Analytics Can Be Integrated Into the System

Here’s how we can structure and integrate these CRM analytics:

1. Key CRM Metrics to Track

✅ Customer Acquisition & Retention
	•	CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost): How much it costs to acquire a new passenger.
	•	CRC (Customer Retention Cost): The cost of keeping an existing passenger engaged.

✅ Churn & Loyalty
	•	Churn Rate: The percentage of customers who stop booking flights.
	•	CLV (Customer Lifetime Value): The total revenue a customer generates over their lifetime.
	•	NPS (Net Promoter Score): A measure of customer loyalty.

📌 Next Step: Store these values in the database, updated monthly or quarterly.

2. Customer Segmentation & Profiles

Adding customer segmentation models will allow targeted marketing and service improvements:

✔ New Customers: First-time flyers who recently booked a flight.
✔ Retained Customers: Customers with multiple bookings within 24 months.
✔ Churned Customers: Customers who have not booked for over 24 months.
✔ High-Value Customers (HVCs): Premium travelers with frequent business-class bookings.
✔ Potential Churn Risk: Customers showing a decline in activity.

📌 Next Step: Create a customer profile database with segmentation flags.

3. Analytical Calculations for CRM

📌 Core Analytics to Implement:
✔ Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
✔ Customer Retention Cost (CRC)
✔ Churn Prediction Models
✔ Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)
✔ Net Promoter Score (NPS) & Satisfaction Analysis

📌 Next Step: Implement calculation formulas in the database for real-time analysis.

4. Machine Learning (ML) Models for CRM

Integrating machine learning algorithms will enable predictive insights:

✔ Logistic Regression – Predicts churn probability.
✔ Random Forests – Classifies customer behavior patterns.
✔ Neural Networks – Identifies complex relationships between booking trends and churn.

📌 Next Step: Build ML models that continuously update with new booking data.

5. How These Insights Will Improve Decision-Making

By integrating CRM analytics into the system, airlines can:

🚀 Improve Customer Retention – Identify at-risk customers and offer targeted promotions.
🚀 Maximize Revenue – Understand which passengers generate the most long-term value (CLV).
🚀 Optimize Marketing Spend – Reduce CAC by focusing on high-value acquisition channels.
🚀 Enhance Loyalty Programs – Personalize frequent flyer rewards based on passenger behavior.
