📌 Strategies for Converting Indirect Customers into Direct Customers

Since indirect customers book through OTAs, GDS, and travel agencies, airlines lack direct control over customer relationships. To increase direct bookings and customer retention, airlines need strategic interventions in three key areas:

[1️⃣ Incentivizing Direct Bookings] → [2️⃣ Enhancing the Direct Customer Experience] → [3️⃣ Retargeting Indirect Customers]

Let’s explore these strategies step by step:

1️⃣ Incentivizing Direct Bookings (Shifting Customer Behavior)

📌 How can airlines encourage customers to book directly instead of through third parties?

✔ Exclusive Direct Booking Discounts → Offering lower fares or special promotions for website and mobile app users.
✔ Bonus Loyalty Miles & Points → Providing extra miles, points, or status upgrades for direct bookings.
✔ Special Ancillary Benefits → Free seat selection, priority boarding, or one checked bag only for direct customers.
✔ Fare Transparency & Price Matching → Clearly communicating why booking directly offers better value than OTAs.

	•	Using CRM & AI to provide customized promotions based on customer history, frequent routes, and seasonal trends.

✔ User-Friendly & Fast Booking Experience

3️⃣ Retargeting Indirect Customers (Re-engaging Past OTA & GDS Customers)

📌 How can airlines convert indirect customers into direct customers after their first purchase?

✔ Email & SMS Campaigns After Indirect Bookings
	•	Sending an email like:
“Thank you for flying with us! Next time, book directly through our app and enjoy exclusive benefits!”

✔ Win-Back Offers for Churned Indirect Customers
	•	If an indirect customer hasn’t booked in 12+ months, offering:
✅ A one-time discount for direct booking
✅ A free upgrade or loyalty bonus if they book directly

✔ Loyalty Program Enrollment Targeting Indirect Customers
	•	Encouraging indirect customers to sign up for the airline’s loyalty program to bring them into the CRM system.
	•	Example: “Sign up today and earn 1,000 bonus miles for your next direct booking!”
