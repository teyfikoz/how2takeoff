📦 Basic Aviation Cargo Concepts: Key Calculations & Metrics

Under Basic Aviation Cargo Concepts, airlines and cargo operators perform multiple calculations to optimize payload capacity, revenue, and operational efficiency. Below are key cargo-related calculations and formulas used in aviation.

1. Payload Capacity & Weight Calculations

A. Maximum Payload Calculation

The maximum payload is the total weight of cargo, passengers, and baggage that an aircraft can carry, calculated as:

￼

📌 Example:
	•	Max Takeoff Weight (MTOW): 254,011 kg
	•	Empty Operating Weight (OEW): 128,850 kg
	•	Fuel Load: 85,000 kg
	•	Max Payload:
￼

2. Cargo Volume & Load Factor Calculations

A. Cargo Volume Utilization

Cargo space is limited by both weight capacity and volume capacity. The formula for cargo volume utilization is:

￼

📌 Example:
	•	Actual Cargo Loaded: 80 m³
	•	Max Available Cargo Volume: 100 m³
	•	Utilization:
￼

B. Cargo Load Factor (Weight-Based)

Cargo Load Factor measures how efficiently cargo space is used, based on weight instead of volume:

￼

📌 Example:
	•	Actual Cargo Weight: 35,000 kg
	•	Max Cargo Capacity: 40,000 kg
	•	Cargo Load Factor:
￼

3. Revenue & Cost Calculations

A. Revenue per Freight Ton Kilometer (FTK)

FTK (Freight Ton Kilometer) is the revenue-generating weight-distance of cargo flights.

￼

📌 Example:
	•	Cargo Weight: 30,000 kg = 30 tons
	•	Distance: 5,000 km
	•	FTK:
￼

B. Cargo Yield Calculation (Revenue per Ton-Kilometer)

Cargo yield determines the revenue earned per ton-kilometer:

￼

📌 Example:
	•	Cargo Revenue: $600,000
	•	Total FTK: 150,000
	•	Cargo Yield:
￼

C. Break-Even Load Factor (BELF) for Cargo

Break-even load factor (BELF) is the minimum cargo load required to cover operating costs:

￼

📌 Example:
	•	Total Operating Cost: $500,000
	•	Total Cargo Revenue: $600,000
	•	BELF:
￼

✈️ If the cargo load factor exceeds 83.3%, the airline is profitable.

4. Fuel Consumption & Efficiency Metrics

A. Fuel Burn per Ton-Kilometer (FBTK)

Fuel efficiency in cargo operations is measured as:

￼

📌 Example:
	•	Total Fuel Burn: 120,000 kg
	•	Total FTK: 150,000
	•	FBTK:
￼

B. Fuel Cost per Ton-Kilometer (FCTK)

Fuel cost per ton-kilometer helps in fuel efficiency pricing:

￼

📌 Example:
	•	FBTK: 0.8 kg/ton-km
	•	Fuel Price: $0.90 per kg
	•	FCTK:
￼

5. ULD (Unit Load Device) Optimization

A. ULD Load Factor Calculation

ULDs (pallets or containers) are optimized based on volume or weight:

￼

📌 Example:
	•	Actual Cargo Loaded: 4,000 kg
	•	Max ULD Capacity: 5,000 kg
	•	ULD Load Factor:
￼

6. Dynamic Pricing for Cargo Yield Management

Cargo pricing is adjusted based on supply and demand, fuel prices, and route profitability. Key formulas include:

A. Dynamic Pricing Model for Cargo Rates

￼

📌 Example:
	•	Base Rate: $2.00/kg
	•	Fuel Surcharge: 10%
	•	Demand Factor: 15%
	•	Final Cargo Rate:
￼
