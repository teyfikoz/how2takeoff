1. What is Airline CRM Analytics? 🤔

📌 Definition:
CRM (Customer Relationship Management) analytics is how airlines use data to understand their customers, improve services, and increase profits.

📌 Why is it Important?
✅ It helps airlines find new customers 🛫
✅ It keeps existing customers happy and coming back 😊
✅ It predicts which customers might leave 🚶‍♂️
✅ It helps airlines make more money per passenger 💰

Example:

An airline notices that business travelers often book last-minute flights. Using CRM analytics, they send special offers for last-minute bookings, increasing ticket sales.

2. How Airlines Calculate Customer Costs 💸

2.1 Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) – Cost to Get a New Customer

📌 Definition: The money an airline spends on ads, promotions, and discounts to attract a new customer.

📌 Formula:
\[
CAC = \frac{\text{Marketing & Sales Costs}}{\text{New Customers Gained}}
\]

📌 Example:
An airline spends $500,000 on marketing and gains 10,000 new customers.
￼

2.2 Customer Retention Cost (CRC) – Cost to Keep a Customer

📌 Definition: The money spent on loyalty programs, special offers, and customer service to keep an existing customer.

📌 Example:
The airline spends $200,000 on loyalty programs to keep 50,000 customers.
￼

2.3 Customer Win-Back Cost – Cost to Bring Back a Lost Customer

📌 Definition: The money spent on special discounts or offers to convince a customer who stopped flying with the airline to return.

📌 Example:
If a passenger hasn’t flown in a year, the airline sends a 20% discount to encourage them to book again.

3. How Airlines Calculate Customer Value (CLV) 💰

📌 Definition:
Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) is how much money a customer will spend on the airline over time.

📌 Formula:
￼

📌 Example:
	•	A customer spends $600 per flight
	•	Flies twice a year
	•	Stays loyal for 5 years

￼

📌 Why Does It Matter?
✅ Airlines focus on customers with high CLV (frequent flyers, business travelers).
✅ Loyal customers spend more than one-time travelers.
