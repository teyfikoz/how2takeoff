API Documentation
The Aviationstack API was built to provide a simple way of accessing global aviation data for real-time, historical flights, and future flights as well as allow customers to tap into an extensive data set of airline routes and other up-to-date aviation-related information. Requests to the REST API are made using a straightforward HTTP GET URL structure and responses are provided in lightweight JSON format.

The following API documentation can be applied for any major programming language and will present general integration guides and explanations around API endpoints, request parameters and response objects. If any questions remain unanswered for you, simply reach out to the aviationstack support team for assistance.

Getting Started
API Access Key & Authentication
After creating an aviationstack account, you will be able to retrieve your unique API access key using your account dashboard. Each aviationstack account can only be assigned one API access key.

To connect to the API, simply attach the access_key parameter to any valid API endpoint URL and set it to your access key. Find an example below, you can click the button on the right side of the code to execute the shown API request.

Run API Requesthttps://api.aviationstack.com/v1/flights
    ? access_key = ecc06cb4a106e3d563f1ddaeec905ce4

Keep your key safe: To prevent unauthorized access to your aviationstack account, please make sure to keep your API access key safe at all times. You can always generate a new key using your account dashboard.

256-bit HTTPS EncryptionAvailable on: All Plans
Customers registered for the Aviationstack with any plans may connect to the API using industry-standard 256-bit HTTPS (SSL) encryption. You don’t need a paid plan for accessing HTTPS protocol anymore.

Example API Request:

https://api.aviationstack.com

API Errors
If your request to the aviationstack API does not succeed, the API will return a JSON error response that contains error code and message objects indicating the type of error that occurred. The API also supports HTTP status codes, returning a code of 200 for successful requests, and an error status code (e.g. 404) for failed requests.

If a validation error occurs, hence, an API parameter is used in an invalid way, there will be an additional context object containing multiple sub-objects with the associated API parameter as the key and details about the given validation error(s) further sub-objects. Each instance of a validation error contains key and message objects.

Example Error:

{
   "error": {
      "code": "validation_error",
      "message": "Request failed with validation error",
      "context": {
         "flight_date": [
            {
               "key": "invalid_flight_date",
               "message": "The flight date must be a valid date in the format YYYY-MM-DD."
            }
         ]
      }
   }
}

Common API Errors:

Note: flight blocks within a codeshared block take precedence over those outside it for filtering purposes. So, if there is a flight block inside codeshared, then it will search the query param to match in this codeshared>flight>iataNumber. If codeshared block is not present then it will refer to the flight>iataNumber.

Using Flight Future Schedules endpoint, you can get the data about future flight schedule.

AutocompleteAvailable on: Basic Plan and higher
As outlined for some API endpoints, the aviationstack API is capable of providing result suggestions based on a search term that can be used for autocomplete features in your application. To get autocomplete suggestions, simply attach the search parameter to the API request URL of any supported API endpoint and set it to a search term of your choice.

Supported API Endpoints:

Airports Endpoint: /airports
Airlines Endpoint: /airlines
Airplanes Endpoint: /airplanes
Aircraft Types Endpoint: /aircraft_types
Aviation Tax Endpoint: /taxes
Cities Endpoint: /cities
Countries Endpoint: /countries

Example API Request: In the following example we search for suggestions for airlines based on the term "american".

Run API Requesthttps://api.aviationstack.com/v1/airlines
    ? access_key = ecc06cb4a106e3d563f1ddaeec905ce4
    & search = american

Example API Response:

{
   "pagination": {
       "limit": 100,
       "offset": 0,
       "count": 100,
       "total": 1
   },
   "data": [
      {
         "airline_name": "American Airlines",
         "iata_code": "AA",
         "iata_prefix_accounting": "1",
         "icao_code": "AAL",
         "callsign": "AMERICAN",
         "type": "scheduled",
         "status": "active",
         "fleet_size": "963",
         "fleet_average_age": "10.9",
         "date_founded": "1934",
         "hub_code": "DFW",
         "country_name": "United States",
         "country_iso2": "US"
      },
      [...]
   ]
}

Please note: The API response above has been shortened to show only one country result for readability purposes. To learn more about API response objects of this particular API endpoint, please jump to the Airlines API endpoint.

JSONP Callbacks
The aviationstack API supports JSONP Callbacks. To use the JSONP functionality, simply append the callback parameter to your API endpoint URL and set it to a function name of your choice. If a function name is provided, the API will return your API response wrapped inside the tags of the function you specified.

Example API Request:

Run API Requesthttps://api.aviationstack.com/v1/flights
    ? access_key = ecc06cb4a106e3d563f1ddaeec905ce4
    & callback = MY_FUNCTION

Example API Response:

MY_FUNCTION ({
   {
   [...]
   }
})

Please note: The API also supports Access-Control (CORS) headers.

lang
Using the translations function in the API with &lang= will slow down the API calls they involve a lot of translations of airports, cities, and countries. Therefore it is recommended to use it in combination with other filters to reduce the amount of data you receive in the response

Business Continuity - API Overages
Ensuring our customers achieve success is paramount to what we do at APILayer. For this reason, we will be rolling out our Business Continuity plan guaranteeing your end users will never see a drop in coverage. Every plan has a certain amount of API calls that you can make in the given month. However, we would never want to cut your traffic or impact user experience negatively for your website or application in case you get more traffic.

What is an overage?
An overage occurs when you go over a quota for your API plan. When you reach your API calls limit, we will charge you a small amount for each new API call so we can make sure there will be no disruption in the service we provide to you and your website or application can continue running smoothly.

Prices for additional API calls will vary based on your plan. See table below for prices per call and example of an overage billing.

Plan Name	Monthly Price	Number of Calls	Overage Price per call	Overage	Total price
Basic	$49.99	10,000	0.009998	2,000	$69.99
Professional	$149.99	50,000	0.0059996	10,000	$209.99
Business	$499.99	250,000	0.00399992	50,000	$699.99
Why does APILayer have overage fees?
Overage fees allow developers to continue using an API once a quota limit is reached and give them time to upgrade their plan based on projected future use while ensuring API providers get paid for higher usage.

How do I know if I will be charged for overages?
When you are close to reaching your API calls limit for the month, you will receive an automatic notification (at 75%, 90% and 100% of your monthly quota). However, it is your responsibility to review and monitor for the plan’s usage limitations. You are required to keep track of your quota usage to prevent overages. You can do this by tracking the number of API calls you make and checking the dashboard for up-to-date usage statistics.

How will I be charged for my API subscription?
You will be charged for your monthly subscription plan, plus any overage fees applied. Your credit card will be billed after the billing period has ended.

What happens if I don’t have any overage fees?
In this case, there will be no change to your monthly invoice. Only billing cycles that incur overages will see any difference in monthly charges. The Business Continuity plan is an insurance plan to be used only if needed and guarantees your end users never see a drop in coverage from you.

What if I consistently have more API calls than my plan allows?
If your site consistently surpasses the set limits each month, you may face additional charges for the excess usage. Nevertheless, as your monthly usage reaches a certain threshold, it becomes more practical to consider upgrading to the next plan. By doing so, you ensure a smoother and more accommodating experience for your growing customer base.

I would like to upgrade my plan. How can I do that?
You can easily upgrade your plan by going to your Dashboard and selecting the new plan that would be more suitable for your business needs. Additionally, you may contact your Account Manager to discuss a custom plan if you expect a continuous increase in usage.
