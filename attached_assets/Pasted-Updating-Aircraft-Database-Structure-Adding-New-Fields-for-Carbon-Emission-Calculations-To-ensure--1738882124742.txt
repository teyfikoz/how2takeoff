Updating Aircraft Database Structure: Adding New Fields for Carbon Emission Calculations

To ensure accurate fuel consumption and carbon emission calculations, your Aircraft Database needs to be updated with new fields. Below, I will outline:
	1.	Current Aircraft Database Fields
	2.	New Fields to Add for Better Data & Calculations
	3.	Updated Table Structure for Displaying Aircraft Information
	4.	How to Update the Admin Panel for New Inputs
	5.	SQL Schema Update for the Database

1. Current Aircraft Database Fields

Your existing aircraft database includes the following fields:

Field Name	Description
Aircraft Name	Aircraft model (e.g., Boeing 787-9)
Max Payload (kg)	Maximum weight the aircraft can carry (passengers + cargo)
Empty Weight (kg)	Aircraft’s weight without passengers, fuel, or cargo
Fuel Capacity (kg)	Maximum amount of fuel the aircraft can hold
Cruise Speed (kt)	Typical cruising speed in knots
Max Altitude (ft)	Maximum operational altitude of the aircraft
Max Takeoff Weight (kg)	Maximum weight at takeoff
Base Fuel Flow (kg/hr)	Fuel burn per hour
Max Range (nm)	Maximum distance the aircraft can fly
Cargo Capacity (kg)	Maximum weight of cargo that can be carried
Min Capacity	Minimum number of passengers the aircraft can accommodate
Max Capacity	Maximum number of passengers the aircraft can accommodate
Speed (km/h)	Average speed during cruise

2. New Fields to Add for Fuel & Carbon Emission Calculations

These new fields will allow better tracking of fuel efficiency, CO₂ emissions, and operating costs.

New Field Name	Description
Fuel Burn per 100 km per seat (L/100km/seat)	Fuel efficiency based on distance & seating
CO₂ Emission Factor (kg CO₂/L)	Conversion rate of fuel burn to CO₂ (default = 2.5 kg CO₂/L)
Fuel Efficiency (L/km)	Fuel consumption per kilometer
Base Fuel Cost (USD/L)	Average cost of fuel per liter
Operating Cost per Hour (USD/hr)	Estimated cost per hour of operation
Turnaround Time (min)	Time needed to refuel, unload, and board before next flight

3. Updated Table Structure for Displaying Aircraft Information

Once a new aircraft is added to the database, it should be displayed with both existing and new fields.

Aircraft Name	Capacity	Range (nm)	Speed (km/h)	Cargo Capacity (kg)	Fuel Burn per 100 km/seat (L)	CO₂ Emission Factor (kg CO₂/L)	Fuel Efficiency (L/km)	Operating Cost per Hour (USD/hr)
Boeing 787-9	290-335	7355	954	52587	2.3	2.5	0.024	$6,500
Airbus A350-900	300-350	8100	945	53300	2.4	2.5	0.025	$6,800
Boeing 737 MAX 8	178-210	6570	839	20865	2.1	2.5	0.021	$3,200

4. Updating the Admin Panel for New Inputs

Your Admin - Aircraft Database form should be updated to allow input for new fuel-related parameters.

📌 Current Inputs:
✔ Aircraft Name
✔ Max Payload (kg)
✔ Empty Weight (kg)
✔ Fuel Capacity (kg)
✔ Cruise Speed (kt)
✔ Max Altitude (ft)
✔ Max Takeoff Weight (kg)
✔ Base Fuel Flow (kg/hr)
✔ Max Range (nm)
✔ Cargo Capacity (kg)
✔ Min Capacity
✔ Max Capacity
✔ Speed (km/h)

📌 New Inputs to Add:
✔ Fuel Burn per 100 km per seat (L/100km/seat)
✔ CO₂ Emission Factor (kg CO₂/L) → Default: 2.5
✔ Fuel Efficiency (L/km)
✔ Base Fuel Cost (USD/L)
✔ Operating Cost per Hour (USD/hr)
✔ Turnaround Time (min)

5. SQL Schema Update for the Database

To reflect these changes in your database, update your SQL schema to include the new columns.

ALTER TABLE Aircrafts
ADD COLUMN fuel_burn_per_100km_seat FLOAT DEFAULT 2.3,
ADD COLUMN co2_emission_factor FLOAT DEFAULT 2.5,
ADD COLUMN fuel_efficiency FLOAT DEFAULT 0.024,
ADD COLUMN base_fuel_cost FLOAT DEFAULT 1.50,
ADD COLUMN operating_cost_per_hour FLOAT DEFAULT 5000,
ADD COLUMN turnaround_time INT DEFAULT 45;

📌 Explanation of New Fields in SQL Table:
	•	fuel_burn_per_100km_seat: Fuel burn per seat per 100 km
	•	co2_emission_factor: CO₂ conversion factor per liter of fuel (default = 2.5 kg CO₂/L)
	•	fuel_efficiency: Fuel consumption per kilometer
	•	base_fuel_cost: Fuel cost per liter
	•	operating_cost_per_hour: Cost of operation per hour
	•	turnaround_time: Turnaround time for the aircraft

6. Summary of Changes & Next Steps

✅ New database fields added for fuel & CO₂ calculations.
✅ Admin panel updated to allow input for additional aircraft performance metrics.
✅ Aircraft display table updated to include new performance data.
✅ SQL database schema updated with new columns.
