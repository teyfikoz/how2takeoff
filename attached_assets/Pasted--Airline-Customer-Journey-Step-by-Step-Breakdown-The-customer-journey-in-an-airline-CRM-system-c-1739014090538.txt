📌 Airline Customer Journey: Step-by-Step Breakdown

The customer journey in an airline CRM system consists of multiple stages, from the first interaction with the airline to customer retention and loyalty. Understanding these stages allows airlines to optimize their marketing, customer experience, and retention strategies.

The journey follows this structured flow:

[Awareness & Search] → [Booking & Data Collection] → [Pre-Flight Experience] → [Flight Experience] → [Post-Flight Engagement] → [Loyalty & Retention]

✈️ 1. Awareness & Search (Customer Interest Phase)

	•	Indirect channels: OTAs (Online Travel Agencies), GDS platforms, corporate travel agencies.
	•	Airlines collect anonymous browsing data (searched routes, dates, device type) to retarget customers with relevant offers.
